                description="The Regency Young Scholar Science Program aims to bridge the gap 
                in science education for children who may not have access to hands-on learning 
                experiences. Through engaging experiments and activities, the program introduces
                 fundamental scientific principles in an accessible and fun way. 
                 By fostering curiosity and exploration, 
                 it not only enhances scientific knowledge but also nurtures critical 
                 thinking and problem-solving skills from an early age. 
                 The program strives to inspire a lifelong passion for science, 
                 encouraging children to see the world through an analytical lens 
                 and empowering them to become future innovators and leaders in 
                 their communities. I was one of the individuals responsible for teaching the kids, 
                 guiding them through experiments and 
                 activities to help them develop a deeper understanding of scientific concepts."

                description="This video showcases a preliminary design of the website project that I participated in. My group and I created a DevJournal website based on the design we developed. 
                The website was built to provide a structured and engaging platform for developers to document their projects, share insights, and collaborate. 
                From conceptualizing the user interface in Figma to implementing the final web application, 
                our team worked together to bring the design to life, 
                ensuring both functionality and an intuitive user experience."

                I was responsible for the coding aspect of this project, implementing the navigation 
                programs using Arduino to control the rover's movement and decision-making in the simulated environment."
