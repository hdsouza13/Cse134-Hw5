### Index.html

Implemented a underline line under the links, so it will be easier to the user see on which link he will open

### Contact.css

The send button was vanishing because of the backgroud, so I fix it and put a little of animation on it

###Comments

Implement some comments in the html files, so it will be more organized

###Folders 

I organized my files into CSS, HTML and JS folders

###Theme mode 

I used the same js code for the theme modes, but implemented the same code for all pages, but using different js files, so I created a single js file for the theme mode, and I also implemented a button to open and close the mode settings window.
